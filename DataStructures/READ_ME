All files in this directory are implementation of a data structure in Python 3.

For ease of reading and record keeping, I am listing them down-
1. Linked List (All operations) - DONE
2. Stack - DONE
3. Queue - DONE
4. Priority Queue - DONE
5. Double Ended Queue
6. Double Linked List
7. Circular Linked List
8. Hashing for numerical and string values (Can be extended to Hash-Maps)
9. Tree with BFS and DFS


For my personal reference and future revisions, I am listing down more details about each implementation. The bullet number below follows
the bullet sequence as per the list above.

2. Stack ######

-I implemented it using linked list, it could have been done by array also.
-Arrays would limit the size of stack, and would now allow dynamic size increase (that can be overcome by array resizing once array
reaches the size limit, but it will waste memory if stack grows too much but is only larger marginally by the half of array size)
-Linked list can grow and shrink as per need, but additional memory is used to maintain pointers to the next nodes

3. Queue ######

-The time for insertion and deletion is O(1) and for displaying the queue elements is O(n)

4. Priority Queue ######

-The time for insertion is O(n) as comparison is done for priority of each element, but for deletion is O(1)
-Imagine all elements with highest priority are on the left (tail) side and all with lower are towards right (head) side
-Dequeuing is done at the left(tail) side
