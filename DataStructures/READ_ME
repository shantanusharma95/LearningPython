All files in this directory are implementation of a data structure in Python 3.

1. Linked List (All operations) - DONE
2. Stack - DONE
3. Queue
4. Priority Queue
5. Double Ended Queue
6. Double Linked List
7. Circular Linked List
8. Hashing for numerical and string values (Can be extended to Hash-Maps)
9. Tree with BFS and DFS


For my personal reference and future revisions, I am listing down more details about each implementation.
