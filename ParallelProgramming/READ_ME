Under this directory, I have placed more directories. Each directory contains the code files along with an output log, where the time
taken to run the program is recorded to depict the differences between serial and parallel program - also note, the code is doing the

I have purposely uploaded my output logs - they can differ based on system configuration. I would recommend executing the code in a Python
virtual environment. As I personally use Microsoft Visual Studio, below is the guide to begin with virtual environment on the same-

Below is a summary of what each sub-directory contains.

  - SerialRun : Contains the code which is executed serially
